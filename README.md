**A step-by-step guide to building deep learning models using TensorFlow, Keras, and MXNet**

## What is this book about?
Deep learning is a powerful subset of machine learning that is very successful in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). This second edition of R Deep Learning Essentials will open the gates for you to enter the world of neural networks by building powerful deep learning models using the R ecosystem.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Build shallow neural network prediction models
* Prevent models from overfitting the data to improve generalizability
* Explore techniques for finding the best hyperparameters for deep learning models
* Create NLP models using Keras and TensorFlow in R
* Use deep learning for computer vision tasks

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
x <- layer_dot(list(cust_flat, prod_flat), axes = 1)
x <- layer_add(list(x, ub_flat))
x <- layer_add(list(x, mb_flat))
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This second edition of R Deep Learning Essentials is for aspiring data scientists, data analysts, machine learning developers, and deep learning enthusiasts who are well versed in machine learning concepts and are looking to explore the deep learning paradigm using R. Fundamental understanding of the R language is necessary to get the most out of this book.
